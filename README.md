# GTAV-Override-Framework

**What is GTAV Override?**
*GTAVOverride* is essentially a script that stops all base game scripts. It does so, at start once the loading screen is completed. It does work on new and existing savegame. When using this mod in a new game, you will simply be free, but locked in the first bank from the prologue. The point is to extend on that thought, to create a new start.
