# GTAV-Override  
  
**What is GTAV Override?**  
GTAVOverride is a mod with toggle-able/configurable integrated features, it also stops all normal single-player scripts so the most basic things like death become very plain, this allows to re-define the whole single-player experience.  
Some or most of the features are dependent on the fact that GTAV single-player script are killed.  
So the mod try to provide remake functionalities like death/arrest, savegame, persistence and more ways of making money in a custom sandbox environment.  
  
Trying to combine this mod with other mod is at your own risk, try playing with config file GTAVOverride.ini if you experience incompatibilities. It may resolve them.  
  
The KillScript kills all 515+ scripts when the loading screen has completed. If you manually load a savegame or start a new game you will have to refresh scripts with your hotkey to restart it. You can change the delay before the kill-script is executed. You can also force this mod to ONLY KILL SCRIPTS if it's the only thing you need.  
  
You can now NOT KILL the scripts to use this mod in normal single player, you will need to cherry pick the scripts you enable.  
  
I will make a exception list in the future so that we can cherry pick any scripts, will need further testing.
