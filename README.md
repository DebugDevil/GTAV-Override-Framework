# GTAV-Override  
  
**What is GTAV Override?**  
GTAVOverride is a mod-pack with toggle-able/configurable integrated mods.  
Some or most are dependent on the fact that GTAV single-player script are killed.  
So the mod try to provide new functionality like persistence and more ways of making money in a sandbox single-player experience.  
  
Trying to combine this mod with other mod is at your own risk.  
Try disabling some Scripts in GTAVOverride.ini file if you experience incompatibility.  
  
The KillScript kills all 515+ scripts when the loading screen has completed. If you manually load a savegame or start a new game you will have to refresh scripts with your hotkey to restart it. You can change the delay before the kill-script is executed. You can also force this mod to ONLY KILL SCRIPTS if it's the only thing you need.
